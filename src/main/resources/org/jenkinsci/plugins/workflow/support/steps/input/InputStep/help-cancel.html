<p>
    You can customize the text for the "abort" button to better match the context.
</p>

<p>Usage: <code>input message: 'Would you like to skip the next step?', ok: "Yes", cancel: "No, run anyway"</code></p>

<p>Which will look like:
<pre>
        Would you like to skip the next step?
        Yes or No, run anyway
    </pre>
</p>
